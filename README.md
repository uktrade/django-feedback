# django-feedback

A Django app to gather and send internal Government staff feedback, e.g. for open beta periods

## Installation

```
pip install django-feedback-govuk
```

1. Add `django-feedback` to your INSTALLED_APPS settings:

```py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'crispy_forms',
    'crispy_forms_gds',
    'django_feedback_govuk',
]
```

2. Create a new email template in the GovUk Notify service, making sure to create a ((feedback_url)) field.

> Note that ((feedback_url)) will be a link to the listing view, not an individual piece of feedback.

You'll need an API key and template ID from the gov.uk Notify service.

3. Add the following settings to the file:

```py
# Crispy forms
CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = ["gds"]
CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "gds"

# Gov Notify
GOVUK_NOTIFY_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"

# Django Feedback GovUK
DJANGO_FEEDBACK_GOVUK = {
    "SERVICE_NAME": "<your-service>",
    "FEEDBACK_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "FEEDBACK_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS": ["email@example.com"],
}
```

The email addresses are for every recipient that should get an email when feedback is submitted.

3. Build your own templates

Override the built-in templates by making new templates in your app under the
`django_feedback_govuk/templates` path. You'll need templates for `submit.html`, `confirm.html`
and `listing.html`, each of which should load its respective template tag from `feedback_submit`,
`feedback_confirm` and `feedback_listing`.

For example:

```py
{# /your-project/templates/django_feedback_govuk/templates/submit.html #}
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load feedback_tags %}
{% block content %}
    {% feedback_submit %}
{% endblock content %}
```

> If you'd like to use the templatetags without causing page loads to new views

4. Add the URLs to your project

```py
from django_feedback_govuk import urls as feedback_urls


urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path("feedback/", include(feedback_urls)),
    ...
]
```

5. Set up user permissions
